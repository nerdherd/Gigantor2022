# Gigantor2022

As of now, Gigantor is not functional. We plan to update the radio and RoboRIO to 2022, and write new code for the robot in 2022 WPILib Visual Studio Code. The idea is to rewrite the project to be compatible with 2022 firmware and remove parts of the project that are unnecessary for the robot to be functional (ex. Autos).
